## Trading Functions

### DrawOrderBlocks()

### DetectTrends()

This function detects trends in the market by analyzing price movements and patterns. It helps to determine the direction of the market and identify potential trading opportunities.

### DetectImbalances()

This function identifies imbalances in the market, which are areas where there is a significant difference between supply and demand. Imbalances can indicate potential price reversals or strong support/resistance levels.

### ShowOrderBlocks()

This function displays the order blocks on the chart when enabled. It provides visual representation of the identified order blocks and their locations.

### HideOrderBlocks()

This function hides the order blocks on the chart when disabled. It allows users to remove the visual representation of order blocks if desired.

### FocusOnImbalances()

This function filters out non-imbalance related data and focuses on detecting imbalances only. It helps to reduce noise and improve the accuracy of detecting potential trading opportunities.

### DisplayAlertSignal()

This function displays an alert signal when potential market changes are detected. It can be used to notify the user of possible trading opportunities or changes in market conditions.

### DisplayLongWickRejectionSignal()

This function displays a long wick rejection signal when a potential price reversal is identified. It helps to identify areas where price has rejected a certain level and may reverse its direction.

## How It Works

The Order Blocks Finder MT5 is a trading robot that combines various functions to identify and analyze order blocks in the forex market. It starts by drawing order blocks on the chart using the DrawOrderBlocks() function. Then, it detects trends and identifies imbalances in the market using the DetectTrends() and DetectImbalances() functions, respectively.

The ShowOrderBlocks() function is used to display the order blocks on the chart, and the HideOrderBlocks() function can be used to hide them if desired. The FocusOnImbalances() function filters out non-imbalance related data to focus only on detecting imbalances.

The DisplayAlertSignal() function displays an alert signal when potential market changes are detected. This can help traders identify trading opportunities or changes in market conditions. Similarly, the DisplayLongWickRejectionSignal() function displays a signal when a potential price reversal is identified based on long wick rejection patterns.

To execute the trading robot, the main function OnStart() calls all the necessary trading functions in the desired order. Finally, it prints a message indicating the successful execution of the Order Blocks Finder MT5 program.
